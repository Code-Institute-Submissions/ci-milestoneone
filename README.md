This website is going to be used as advertisment and promotion of a band call The Monkees.

I would like the home page to give readers an insight into the band along with some history about members and songs.
In the home page I would like to advertise the bands availability to do some private functions like weddings, christmas parties etc.

I would like to have separate links on home page to songs, band members, testimonials and a booking (availability) page.
Each of these links will be separate pages within the website and be easily navigated by the user to provide the information they require and holding their attention to the page and links purpose.

I would like to achieve a well built and structured website thats easily navigated by the user and easy on the eyes retaining the attention of the user while being informative and explaining the purpose and goals of the band.
