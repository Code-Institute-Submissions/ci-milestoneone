This website is going to be used as advertisment and promotion of a band call The Monkees.

I would like the home page to give readers an insight into the band along with some history about members and songs.
In the home page I would like to advertise the bands availability to do some private functions like weddings, christmas parties etc.

I would like to have information relating to the band, audio clips and video clips. This will act as a preview of the band informing 
the user of their current songs and tracks. I would also like to achieve a section where the user is able to enquire about the band and 
check availability for weddings and functions etc.

I would like to achieve a well built and structured website thats easily navigated by the user and easy on the eyes retaining the attention
of the user while being informative and explaining the purpose and goals of the band.
