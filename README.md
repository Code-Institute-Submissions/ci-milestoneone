![alt text](https://github.com/mattjboland/ci-milestoneone/blob/master/images/monkees12.jpg)

This website is going to be used as advertisment and promotion of a band call The Monkees. It gives the user a basic history of the 
band and provide audio clips and a video clip for them to enjoy. It informs the user of the services they provide and will have 
testimonials from previous customers. It has an enquiry page where the user will input their email with a view to getting some
feedback on the services they provide or even book. I have built and structured a website thats easily navigated by the user and easy 
on the eyes retaining the attention of the user while being informative and explaining the purpose and goals of the band.

## UX

The purpose of this website project is to create a site for the 1960's band The Monkees who have 50 years experience and have sold 
approximately 75 million albums worldwide. The target audience for this website will be the fans who wish to use the website for 
video and audio clips and to get informed about the services they provide. Also potential fans who use this site will be attracted
by the pictures and descriptions of the band, also the audio and video clips.

**I used the following features on the website for the user to achieve these goals**

* A brief description of the Band
* Audio clips for the user to experience
* Serices, what the band can be booked for
* Video clip for the user to experience
* A brief description on each band members
* Testimonials, what others have said
* Enquiry page where users can enter and email and be contacted
* Social links to Facebook, Twitter and YouTube

## Features

[Home Page](https://ci-milestoneone-mattjboland.c9users.io/index.html)

*Carousel - I used this to display some images on each page of the website

I would like the home page to give readers an insight into the band along with some history about members and songs.
In the home page I would like to advertise the bands availability to do some private functions like weddings, christmas parties etc.

I would like to have information relating to the band, audio clips and video clips. This will act as a preview of the band informing 
the user of their current songs and tracks. I would also like to achieve a section where the user is able to enquire about the band and 
check availability for weddings and functions etc.
